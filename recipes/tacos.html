    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Slow cooker chicken tacos are a delicious, hands-off meal perfect for busy
      days. Simply combine boneless, skinless chicken breasts with your favorite
      taco seasoning, salsa, and a bit of lime juice in a slow cooker. As it
      simmers for several hours, the chicken becomes incredibly tender and
      flavorful, soaking up all the spices and juices. Once cooked, it easily
      shreds with a fork, making it ideal for tacos, burrito bowls, or even
      quesadillas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe is highly customizable — you can add diced onions, jalapeños,
      corn, or black beans to the slow cooker for extra flavor and texture.
      Serve the shredded chicken in soft or hard taco shells and top with your
      favorites like shredded lettuce, cheese, avocado, sour cream, or cilantro.
      It's a satisfying, crowd-pleasing meal with minimal effort.
