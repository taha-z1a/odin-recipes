    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Italian Cherry Margarita is a vibrant and refreshing twist on the
      classic margarita, combining the tang of fresh lime juice with the rich,
      sweet flavor of Italian Amarena cherries. This cocktail blends tequila,
      cherry liqueur (or syrup from Amarena cherries), lime juice, and a hint of
      triple sec or Cointreau, creating a beautiful deep red drink that’s both
      bold and balanced. Served over ice and garnished with a cherry or lime
      wheel, it’s a visually striking and deliciously smooth drink that adds
      elegance to any gathering.

    <p>
      This drink is perfect for summer evenings, dinner parties, or just
      treating yourself with something fruity and festive. The cherry flavor
      adds a unique depth to the traditional margarita profile, while the lime
      keeps it crisp and bright. It pairs well with Italian appetizers, grilled
      dishes, or spicy Mexican cuisine. Whether you're a cocktail enthusiast or
      trying something new, the Italian Cherry Margarita is a fun, flavorful
      drink worth sipping.
