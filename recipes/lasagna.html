    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of rich meat sauce,
      creamy béchamel, and tender sheets of pasta. This hearty meal is perfect
      for family dinners or special occasions. The secret to a great lasagna
      lies in slow-cooked tomato sauce and a perfect balance of cheese and
      herbs. Whether you're using ground beef, sausage, or going vegetarian, the
      dish always turns out comforting and satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, lasagna is made with ricotta or béchamel sauce, mozzarella
      cheese, and grated Parmesan layered between sheets of lasagna noodles.
      After baking in the oven until bubbly and golden brown on top, it’s best
      served hot with garlic bread or a fresh green salad. Leftovers taste even
      better the next day, making it a meal that keeps on giving.
